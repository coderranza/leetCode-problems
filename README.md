## Two Sum
### Instructions
Given an array of integers **nums** and an integer **target**, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to_ **target**.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example**
```sh
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9,
we return [0, 1].
```

## Add Two Numbers

### Instructions
You are given two **non-empty** linkeds lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a sngle digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example**
```sh
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string **s**, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example**
```sh
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```
